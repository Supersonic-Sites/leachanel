        position: CEO at Tulip.com
        desc: She uses hand-picked top-of-the-line natural products and doesn't charge
          extra for the upscale quality. I had the best time at this salon. It's
          elegantly appointed but the owner is so friendly and down to earth.
          Loved, loved, loved my pedicure. Done by an artiste. No extra charge
          for the pedi waxing and it was amazing cream wax! Ultraviolet light
          sterilizer so equipment is super clean. I'll be back for more services
          for sure.

        desc: Léa is an extremely talented esthetician! She is professional, and a joy
          to work with. She did my wedding day makeup, and makeup for some of my
          bridesmaids and mother, and did a fantastic job. Many members of my
          bridal party, including myself, used her services for manicures and
          pedicures as well. I highly recommend Léa Chanel Beauty. I can assure
          you, you will not be disappointed! ✨

        desc: Lea did my makeup for my wedding and I couldn't have been happier! She was
          so sweet, kind and very professional. She replied quickly and
          professionally to any and all my questions and arrived at my house the
          morning of the wedding ready to go! Her makeup application was exactly
          what I was looking for and I felt amazing all day. I couldn't have
          asked for a better makeup artist for my special day.

        position: CEO at Tulip.com
        desc: Léa provided a wonderful experience for me when I went for some
          pre-wedding beautifying and relaxation. She gave me a mani/pedi as
          well as a facial and waxing, all of which I was very pleased with.
          She’s great to talk to and has a lot of helpful knowledge and advice
          about caring for skin naturally.
