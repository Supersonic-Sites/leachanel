      - service: Classic Facial
        desc: >-
          <strong>Duration: 1 hour 30 minutes</strong><br>

          Good for ALL skin types. In the Classic Facial, we'll be treating your skin according to its needs, based on your skin type and skin condition. The main goal is to refresh, hydrate, and target-treat certain goals with potent active ingredients. Gentle neck, shoulders, & hand massage included. Effective, gentle, and safe for sensitive skin. (Pregnant women should go for the Express Glow Facial instead.)
      - service: BioAcne Facial
        desc: >-
          <strong>Duration: 1 hour</strong><br>

          In the Anti Acne Bio Facial, we'll work on deep cleansing the skin and purging the built-up sebum and bacteria clogged in the pores, all while respecting the skin's natural PH balance. We will do a gentle organic Salicylic Acid Peel to eat away at dead & dry skin that is trapping the the unwanted impurities inside. (No pain, no downtime.) We'll also work on soothing & comforting the skin's redness & inflammation. Skin will be very rosy post-treatment due to healthy oxygenation of the skin. One must wear SPF post-treatment & avoid direct sun exposure for 48 hours.) 
      - service: Anti-Aging Firm & Facial
        desc: >
          <strong>Duration: 1 hour 35 minutes</strong><br>

          Ideal for mature skin types. <br><br>

          In this anti-aging facial, we'll be treating your skin according to its' needs, based on your skin type. The main goal is to firm the skin by working on its tonicity & elasticity with specialized ingredients and massage techniques. At the same time, we will of course target-treat additional conditions such as redness & pigmentation with potent active ingredients. The extra magic, in this facial, is in the organic AHA peel to combat signs of aging & pigmentation spots...a VERY gentle, painless peel, with 0 down time. The chocolately firming & brightening mask leaves you with absolutely radiant skin. <br><br>

          Gentle face, neck, shoulders, & hand massage included.

          Safe for sensitive skin.<br><br>

          (Pregnant women should go for the Express Glow Facial instead.)
      - service: Oxygenation Facial
        desc: >-
          <strong>Duration: 1 hour 30 minutes</strong><br>

          Ideal for dull, thick, blackhead-prone skin. In the Oxygenation Facial, we'll be treating your skin according to its needs, based on your skin type and skin condition. The facial is very similar to the Classic (deep cleaning and good exfoliation), however we will be using a specialized mask that resembles a bubble bath experience, only for the face! The bubble mask forces blood circulation with active ingredients, as it "suffocates" the skin (*you will breath as normal!* No worries, only referring to pores.)<br><br>This forces the skin to "take a huge breath of air" as the mask melts and is removed. You will see the toxins that are extracted off the skin at the end. Gentle neck, shoulders, & hand massage included. Effective and refreshing. (Good for all skin types, excluding extremely sensitive or rosacea-prone skin. Pregnant women should go for the Express Glow Facial instead.)
